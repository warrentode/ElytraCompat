First and foremost, a big thank you goes to my amazing and faithful supporters: Marshal Nash, my father, and my sons,
who have stuck with me in all of my projects, no matter how random or involved they may be.

Additionally, I'd like to express gratitude to theillusivec4, the author of the Curios mod - not just because he made the mod,
but also he's been incredibly helpful any time I've had a question for him about his API while working on my mods. It means a lot
to me that I don't walk away feeling stupid for asking a question, even if my question was a result of misunderstanding something.
And yeah, his collection of mods are well made.

Thank you so much to all of you!
