# Elytra Compat Mod

For now, it's just a forge mod that adds a custom elytra curios slot to the Elytra Slot mod, freeing up the back slot for a backpack or other uses.

This means that with this compat mod you will get one curios back slot and one elytra slot from the start. 
Changes to this can be made in the curios serverconfig file found the world save folder
